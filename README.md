1. All renderable objects, such as meshes, consist of at least two nodes. Which two nodes are required for all renderable objects?

Shape node and Transform node *
Shape node and Material node
Input node and Transform node
Shape node and Input node


2. For most light types, the source of illumination is the light's position. For which type of light is position ignored, and only the rotation of the light
determines the illumination?


area
point
spot
directional *

3.Which type of light is best for a flood studio lighting setup?

directional
area *
spot
point

4.A shot calls for raindrops to fall on a character's hair and clothing. Which dynamics engine allows for all three of these effects elements to realistically
interact with one another?

Nucleus *
Bifrost Fluids
Bullet
MASH

5.What feature allows you to collect specific attributes from various nodes for convenient access and keyframing?

dope sheet
geometry cache
character set *
animation layer

6.You are rendering a scene in software. An object has a Maya native 3D texture applied. How can you adjust the size of the texture relative to the object?

Scale the object transform.
Scale a texture placement node.*
Adjust texture attributes.
Scale the object UVs.

7. This object has two different bitmap textures applied: a repeating brick pattern and a logo graphic. How can you control the placement of each texture
map separately?

layered shader
two UV sets *
layered texture
two materials

8.This graph shows an animation curve output connected to another animation curve input. What might be the purpose of this graph?
anirnCurveTT1

to add curve values
to animate a custom attribute *
to change animation timing
to multiply curve values

9.Camera field of view is indicated by a pyramid shape. What is this shape called?

frustum *
gate mask
clip plane
film back

10.In a physically based renderer such as Amold, what material attribute controls reflectivity according the angle of the surface to the camera? For example,
if you want to make the front-facing surface more reflective relative to the side-facing surface, what attribute should you increase?

Specular Roughness *
Transmission Weight
Anisotropy
Index of Refraction

11. What node type connects shapes to materials and lights?

objectSet
lightLinker
displayLayer
shadingEngine *

12. Which texture type does not require UVs to render in software?

Substance texture
3D texture *
2D texture
File texture

13.Why might you choose Quaternion rotation interpolation over the default Euler interpolation?

Rotations are more reliable.
Curves are easily shaped with tangent handles.
Angle values can be greater than 180 degrees and less than -180 degrees.*
XYZ axes can be keyed independently.
